        <p class="sectiontag1 ">When we listen to music, multiple areas of the brain are activated including those associated with movement, planning, attention and memory. It changes our brain chemistry as well. Listening to music we enjoy stimulates the release of dopamine that makes us feel rewarded.
        </p>
        <p class="sectiontag2 ">Chilling out to calm, soothing quieter music can help to alleviate anxiety, which for stressed out students or high intensity operatives could prove advantageous to reduce stress levels and emotion to improve concentration and focus.

            What matters is recognising how you can consciously choose to use music to improve your mood and level of happiness. Not surprisingly, choosing to listen to happy music boosts our own level of happiness.
            
            Which music is recommended?
            
            Classical Music: If you are doing work with numbers or which requires a lot of attention to detail.
            
            Pop music: For data entry or working to deadlines. It speeds up the rate of work and helps to reduce mistakes.
            
            Ambient music: What I call boring restaurant or airport music. It’s in the background and no one’s really listening to it. It has been shown to be THE best for accuracy if you’re into solving equations. (That counts me out then.)
            
            Dance music: Problem solving or proofreading. This genre was linked to the highest overall accuracy and fastest performance
            
            So should you study/work in quiet or is it OK to listen to music?
            
            The answer as indicated above is – it depends, on our mood, our personality, our musical preferences and our emotional state.

            How does music impact your performance?
            
            Do you use music to boost your mood, to feel happier and more relaxed?
            
            Which genres have you found useful?
            
            I’d love to hear your thoughts.
